Any detections there are false-positives due to the program being able to click for you


Download the files and extract anywhere. Run AutoClickerEmote.exe to start the program.

Full instructions on how to use are inside the program itself

Type in the desired emote's number or use "5" to specify your own clicking interval (in milliseconds). Press enter to proceed to the next step

Place your mouse pointer where you want to click; Press F5 to save this position. Pressing F5 again will begin clicking. Press F6 to change the clicking location (possible to do between clicks or press F5 to pause clicking)

The program (almost) perfectly times each click to perform one emote after another, the closest thing we can get to a perfect loop.
