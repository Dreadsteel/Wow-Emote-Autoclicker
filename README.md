Download the files and extract anywhere. Run AutoClickerEmoteRevamp.exe to start the program.

Full instructions on how to use are inside the program itself

Type in the desired emote's number or use "5" to specify your own clicking interval (in milliseconds). Press enter to proceed to the next step

Place your mouse pointer where you want to click; the program will then save this position and click on that spot indefinitely until the program is closed. The easiest way to close the program when it's clicking is to press Escape.

The program (almost) perfectly times each click to perform one emote after another, the closest thing we can get to a perfect loop.
